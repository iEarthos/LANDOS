The Edible Schoolyard Academy: Creating Garden
and Kitchen Classrooms in Every Community
The Edible Schoolyard Academy trains educators 
to create powerful and sustainable edible education programs
in their schools and communities. Each June, we invite teachers, 
administrators, and advocates from around the world to spend five 
days behind the scenes at the Edible Schoolyard Berkeley.

Learn and experience first-hand the core principles and practical tools 
for bringing academic subjects to life in the kitchen, garden, and lunchroom. 
Whether you are a new or seasoned practitioner, the Academy will strengthen your 
program and build your leadership in the field.
